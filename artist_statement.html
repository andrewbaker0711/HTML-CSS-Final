    <h2>Artist Statement (2019)</h2>
    <p>For the last 15 years, I have dealt with Biopolar Disorder with much of that time being
        unmedicated. As such, for the last decade and a half much of my art focused on finding
        the hope within despair. Leo Tolstoy stated in his short work A Confession, “The horror
        of the darkness was too great, and I wanted to be free of it as quickly as possible by
        means of a rope or a bullet.” In many ways my art was a way to hold myself up and
        resist the darkness. I needed to know I was not alone. It was not a plea for pity, but
        rather a supplication for a friend. My art reached out to those who, like me, needed a
        friend.

    <p>In my current project, my focus has turned away from the human figure to working with
        clay in more of a non-traditional fashion. I have begun to carve clay much like you would
        turn wood on a lathe in an attempt to combine stemware and ceramics in such a way
        that maintains the components of both glass and clay.</p>

    <p> Though my figurative work reaches out more to those who need to know they are not
        alone, my body of work revolves around mending the broken, whether that be taking the
        broken and discarded glass to make a new image or taking a piece of glassware that
        has been broken and deemed unusable and turning it into something functioning and
        new. This theme of rebuilding has always been an important part of my process and
        finished pieces.
